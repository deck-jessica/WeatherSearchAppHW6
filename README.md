# WeatherSearchAppHW6

## Weather Dashboard

This project was undertaken to create a responsive search application to find any city's weather conditions for the current date, as well as provide the 5 day forecast for the city. Upon clicking search, this information will be populated to the page with jquery, and the use of the OpenWeatherAPI to render the results. Once the results are rendered to the page, you can search another city. The search history will also be displayed as buttons, and you could re-search another page. 

This web applicaton is also styled to be responsive to given screen size. This provides accessibility from mobile devices.
